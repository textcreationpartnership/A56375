            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>than any in our days.</l>
            <l>In bounteous Liberality</l>
            <l>he too much did excell,</l>
            <l>And loved men of Quality</l>
            <l>more than exceeding-well:</l>
            <l>His great Revenues all he ſold</l>
            <l>for Wine and coſtly chear,</l>
            <l>He kept three hundred Bow-men bold,</l>

            <l>No Archer living in his time</l>
            <l>with him might well compare:</l>

            <l>So being outlaw'd (as 'tis told)</l>

            <l>a Yeoman bold and free,</l>
            <pb facs="tcp:57169:3"/>
            <l>Who could (if it ſtood him upon)</l>
            <l>with eaſe encounter three:</l>
            <l>One hundred men in all he got,</l>
            <l>with whom (the ſtory ſays)</l>
            <l>Thrée hundred common men durſt not</l>

            <l>Wherein their practiſes were ſuch</l>

            <l>None Rich durſt travel to and fro,</l>
            <l>though ne'r ſo ſtrongly arm'd,</l>
            <l>But by theſe Thieves (ſo ſtrong in ſhow)</l>
            <l>they ſtill were rob'd and harm'd.</l>
            <l>His chiefeſt ſpight to th' Clergy was</l>
            <l>that liv'd in monſtrous pride:</l>
            <l>No one of them he would let paſs</l>
            <l>along the High-way ſide,</l>
            <l>But firſt they muſt to dinner go,</l>
            <l>and afterwards to ſhrift;</l>
            <l>Full many a one he ſerved ſo,</l>
            <l>thus while he liv'd by Theft.</l>
            <l>No Monks nor Fryers he would let go,</l>
            <l>without paying their Fees:</l>
            <l>If they thought much to be uſed ſo,</l>
            <l>their Stones he made them leſe;</l>
            <l>For ſuch as they the Country fill'd</l>
            <l>with Baſtards in thoſe days:</l>
            <pb facs="tcp:57169:4"/>
            <l>Which to prevent, theſe Sparks did geld</l>
            <l>all that came in their ways.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Robin Hood</hi> ſo gentle was,</l>
            <l>and bore ſo brave a mind,</l>
            <l>If any in diſtreſs did paſs,</l>
            <l>to them he was ſo kind,</l>
            <l>That he would give and lend to them</l>
            <l>to help them in their need;</l>
            <l>This made all poor men pray for him</l>
            <l>and wiſh he well might ſpeed.</l>
            <l>The Widow and the Fatherleſs</l>
            <l>he would ſend means unto:</l>
            <l>And thoſe whom famine did oppreſs</l>
            <l>found him a friendly foe.</l>
            <l>Nor would he do a woman wrong,</l>
            <l>but ſee her ſafe convey'd</l>
            <l>He would protect with power ſtrong</l>
            <l>all thoſe who crav'd his aid:</l>
            <l>The Abbot of St. <hi>Maries</hi> then</l>
            <l>who him undid before,</l>
            <l>Was riding with two hundred men,</l>
            <l>and Gold and Silver ſtore:</l>
            <l>But <hi>Robin Hood</hi> upon him ſet,</l>
            <l>with his couragious Sparks,</l>
            <l>And all the Coyn perforce did get,</l>
            <l>which was twelve thouſand Marks:</l>
            <l>He bound the Abbot to a Tree,</l>
            <l>and would not let him paſs,</l>
            <pb facs="tcp:57169:4"/>
            <l>Before that to his men and he</l>
            <l>his Lordſhip had ſaid Maſs:</l>
            <l>Which being done, upon his Horſe</l>
            <l>he ſet him faſt aſtride,</l>
            <l>And with his face towards his Arſe</l>
            <l>he forced him to ride,</l>
            <l>His men were forced to be his guide,</l>
            <l>for he rode backward home:</l>
            <l>The Abbot being thus villify'd,</l>
            <l>did ſorely chafe and fume.</l>
            <l>Thus <hi>Robin Hood</hi> did vindicate</l>
            <l>his former wrongs receiv'd:</l>
            <l>For 'twas this covetous Prelate</l>
            <l>that him of Land bereav'd.</l>
            <l>The Abbot he rode to the King</l>
            <l>with all the haſte he could:</l>
            <l>And to his Grace he every thing</l>
            <l>exactly did unfold:</l>
            <l>And ſaid that if no courſe were ta'n</l>
            <l>by force or ſtratagem,</l>
            <l>To take this Rebel and his Train,</l>
            <l>no man ſhould paſs for them.</l>
            <l>The King proteſted by and by</l>
            <l>unto the Abbot then</l>
            <l>That <hi>Robin Hood</hi> with ſpeed ſhould dye,</l>

            <l>But e're the King did any ſend,</l>
            <l>he did another feat:</l>
            <pb facs="tcp:57169:5"/>
            <l>Which did his Grace much more offend,</l>
            <l>the fact indeed was great:</l>
            <l>For in a ſhort time after that</l>
            <l>the Kings Receivers went</l>
            <l>Towards <hi>London</hi> with the coyn they got,</l>
            <l>for s Highneſs Northern Rent;</l>

            <l>theſe Outlaws lived thus;</l>
            <l>Feared of the Rich, loved of the Poor,</l>
            <l>a thing moſt marvellous.</l>
            <l>A thing impoſſible to us</l>
            <l>this ſtory ſeems to be:</l>

            <l>In thoſe days men more barbarous were,</l>
            <l>and lived leſs in awe:</l>
            <l>Now (God be thanked) people fear</l>
            <l>more to offend the Law.</l>
            <l>No roaring Guns were then in uſe,</l>
            <l>they dreamt of no ſuch thing:</l>
            <l>Our Engliſh men in fight did uſe</l>
            <l>the gallant gray-Gooſe wing;</l>
            <l>In which activity theſe men</l>
            <l>(through practiſe) were ſo good,</l>
            <l>That in thoſe days none equal'd them,</l>

            <l>They'd beat a multitude with ſtaves,</l>
            <l>their Arrows did ſo prick:</l>
            <l>And none durſt neer unto them come,</l>
            <l>unleſs in courteſie;</l>
            <l>All ſuch he bravely would ſend home</l>
            <l>with mirth and jollity;</l>
            <l>Which courteſie won him ſuch love,</l>
